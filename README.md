# Particle Text Editor
Simple, fast and hackable text editor in SDL and C++

# What do I mean by "simple" and "fast"

According to [Focus text editor](https://github.com/focus-editor/focus) :

- Simple: the editor's functionality and code design. It doesn't include a lot of features, and the source code should be simple enough so that people can easily add features if they want to. [...]
- Fast: we try to minimize input latency and maximize responsiveness. We also include relatively fast project search, which should work well for reasonably sized projects.

I personally also am aiming for the same design approach (I don't have that much coding expertise).

- Hackable: Easy to navigate code should allow the user to extend the editor as they see fit

# FAQs

### Why not use XYZ?
I am writing this in [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), but I liked [Atom text editor](https://github.com/atom/atom) and I wanted to fill the void Atom left, so I felt like writing something to that end.

As for focus mentioned above, I like it being so stripped down but I feel like it dosen't have some features I like right now.

### Why not extend XYZ?
> I would love to fork **atom** itself but I passionately dislike JavaScript as a language meant to be written by humans. \
My exposure to C++ before JS probably hinders my ability to code in latter but I like my errors to actually make sense to a human and not be a mishmash of keywords (or even a blank with not even an error code).

> As for **focus**, the program is written in Jai, and Jai is amazing at what it does but it still is not conducive for me to learn a language like Jai given my current status as a college student.
